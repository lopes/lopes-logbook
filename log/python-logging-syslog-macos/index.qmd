Here, I will describe the steps I took to send messages from a Python script to Syslog and how to monitor those logs in macOS. Well, Python (3.9) comes with the `Syslog` module, which handles the process of creating log entries and it is really simple and straightforward. For instance, the line below creates a critical Syslog message:

```python
import syslog
syslog.syslog(syslog.LOG_CRIT, 'hello, syslog!')
```

In my experience, I had to run Python in unbuffered mode passing the `-u` option to the interpreter. Then, to check log files, I noticed that macOS does not work with Syslog like other similar systems. It comes with the `log` utility that has some commands to work with logs. Using the `stream` command with the right parameters and filtering the Python process, I was able to see all logs coming in [almost] real-time when the script was executed (almost like in `tail -f`).

```sh
log stream --info --debug --predicate "process == 'Python'"
```

And that's it! Logging like a boss! :)
