## 👋 Hi, I’m Joe Lopes
I’m an **Information Security Engineer** focused on **threat detection, SIEM, logs, and adversary engagement**. My work lives at the intersection of systems, data, and behavior: observing signals, correlating events, and extracting meaning from noise.

::: {.callout-note}
I’m Brazilian (Portuguese is my native language) and my given name is **José** (pronounced *djo-zeh*).
In English it’s often mispronounced *ho-zay*, which is the Spanish form.
Since José maps naturally to **Joseph**, I go by **Joe**: it’s simpler, clearer, and travels better.
:::

This site, **lopes.log**, is my working notebook: a place where I document investigations, ideas, tools, and the occasional lesson learned the hard way.

There are **no ads** ⛔ here. Just long-form thinking, written slowly and published with intent.

This is a **human-driven space** 👤. All opinions are my own and do not reflect those of my employer. Your privacy is respected. 🫡

## 🦫 Vigil
![Vigil](/static/images/graphic-logo-vigil.png "Vigil, the engineer")

**Vigil** is the beaver of *lopes.log*, and in many ways, my mirror.

> Vigil is **not cute, not angry, not heroic**.
> Vigil is **focused, neutral, and intelligent**.

Like an engineer, Vigil works quietly: observing flows, reading structures, building meaning from fragments. Where others see raw logs, Vigil sees structures.

Vigil represents the way I approach security and systems: with patience, precision, and respect for complexity.

> *At lopes.log, I work with Vigil.*
> *Where others see logs, we see stories.*
