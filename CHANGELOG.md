## 🌟 The Golden Age: 2005–2009

### 2005–2006 — Viva o Linux (VOL)
I began writing articles on Linux and open-source tools at the [Viva o Linux (VOL)](https://www.vivaolinux.com.br/~forkd) community.

I decided to stop due to disagreements over how the articles were moderated (lack of clear criteria from moderators). Since writing proved to be a powerful learning tool and a way to give back to the community, I moved to a platform where I had full autonomy over my content.

### 2007 — Fluxo Livre
In 2007, while working and studying, I created the *Fluxo Livre* (now deprecated ❌) blog on Blogger.

It was short-lived and functioned primarily as an MVP, but it was instrumental in helping me understand blogging platforms and visualize future possibilities.

---

### 2008 — Versão Própria
Around mid-2008, I launched the *Versão Própria* (now deprecated ❌) blog.

I applied everything learned from Fluxo Livre and VOL to improve the quality of my writing. At the time, I was studying Python and LaTeX extensively and had just adopted macOS (Mac OS X Leopard), which became a frequent topic in my posts.

A brief snapshot of this phase appears in this post from October 2008: [https://pipeless.blogspot.com/2008/10/verso-prpria-v30.html](https://pipeless.blogspot.com/2008/10/verso-prpria-v30.html)

### 2009 — Pipeless
In January 2009, dissatisfied with the blog name, I migrated Versão Própria into *Pipeless* ([https://pipeless.blogspot.com](https://pipeless.blogspot.com)).

Details of the migration:

- https://pipeless.blogspot.com/2009/01/blog-v40.html
- https://pipeless.blogspot.com/2009/01/pipeless.html
- https://pipeless.blogspot.com/2009/01/pipeless-20091.html

Unlike the previous migration, this was a direct replacement rather than a new blog. Pipeless became my most successful early project in readership and engagement.

It was eventually deprecated as my studies concluded and personal priorities shifted.

## 🚀 The New Age: 2010–2019

### 2010 — JoseLopes.org
Seeking a professional refresh, I left Blogger and launched a self-hosted WordPress blog at joselopes.org (now deprecated ❌).

This phase focused heavily on infrastructure and web technology learning rather than content production.

---

### 2011 — JoseLop.es
Inspired by the previous experience, I transitioned to joselop.es (now deprecated ❌).

This period coincided with consulting work for small businesses and local governments. Content diversified into technical writing, music, and movies as I prepared for a career shift.

---

### 2012–2013 — Indiecode
I founded a small consultancy named *Indiecode* (indiecode.com.br, now deprecated ❌).

Here I focused on Web 2.0 technologies, JavaScript, Ajax, and programming. The blog was discontinued when I moved fully into information security.

---

### 2012–2014 — Jiloh
I adopted Tumblr’s micro-blogging model with *Jiloh* ([https://jiloh-blog.tumblr.com](https://jiloh-blog.tumblr.com)).

This format allowed me to publish frequently while balancing professional growth. In 2013, I formally transitioned from IT Infrastructure to Information Security.

---

### 2015–2016 — Hakspek
I returned to long-form technical writing with *Hakspek* ([https://hakspek.blogspot.com](https://hakspek.blogspot.com)).

This phase emphasized information security concepts, scripts, and tooling. I also began publishing primarily in English.

---

### 2018–2019 — Medium
With growing leadership responsibilities, I published selectively on Medium: [https://medium.com/@forkd](https://medium.com/@forkd).

Time constraints eventually led to deprecation of this channel.
