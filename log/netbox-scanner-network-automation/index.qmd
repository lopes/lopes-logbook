Back in 2018, I was leading the SOC and NOC teams and although I'm not an excellent network engineer, I always tried to help technically the networking team. On that year we were struggling with the [IPAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address_management) tool and started looking for a replacement. Then we found and tested [NetBox](https://github.com/netbox-community/netbox), an open-source IPAM from [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), and put that into production.

The main concern the NOC had about IPAM is that this tool can be outdated very fast, so I decided to write a tool to automatically discover and update certain subnets. This led to the [netbox-scanner](https://github.com/lopes/netbox-scanner) creation and when finished, this software scanned daily more than 50 subnets, some of them a /21, which resulted in lots of hosts registered and managed automatically.

As the company changed, I left the position of NOC leader focusing on SOC. So the netbox-scanner was forgotten by both teams although some people were still using it—source code was available on GitHub. Despite continually receiving issues and pull-requests, I had no time to improve that code, so I neglected all requests. It last until May 2020, when I decided to use some spare time due to [COVID-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic), to create a brand new version of that script.

At first, I planned the new version, focusing on a modular environment, and documented this in a new issue. After that, I started the repository cleaning process, reviewing all issues for some ideas that could have been added to the project—the feature to use the configuration file from two possible directories was born here.

When the technical part began, I thought it would take at least one month to finish the job since I hadn't been coding for almost 6 months, and I still had my full-time job, so I would code only when idle. To my surprise, all the concepts were fresh in my mind, so I was able to finish the job in only three days, which made me really happy!

Despite this project is not directly secure-related, it was very good to learn or improve some techniques:

- [Logging](https://realpython.com/python-logging/): Using logging to record actions and enable further tracking, good for fully automated scans.
- [Argument parsing](https://realpython.com/command-line-interfaces-python-argparse/): One of the best ways to catch user interactions is directly from the command line.
- [Config files processing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html): Although the CLI is good, when there are many options, it is easier to use configuration files.
- [XML processing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html): Either XML and JSON are excellent standards for interoperability and it is always good to not reinvent the wheel.
- [API usage](https://pynetbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): NetBox has a good API, the [pynetbox](https://github.com/digitalocean/pynetbox), and it implements all actions I needed albeit the documentation is not good.
- [API creation](https://github.com/lopes/netbox-scanner/blob/master/nbs/prime.md): Since I decided to create an integration with Cisco Prime and couldn't find a Python API, I had to create my own—in this case, I used the one I wrote in 2019.
- [Testing](https://realpython.com/python-testing/): Automated tests improve the development lifecycle and enable [CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration)/[CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_delivery)/[DevOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) functions—automated tests should include some security tests too, see [DevSecOps](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-devsecops).
- [Git features](https://backlog.com/git-tutorial/branching/create-branch/): Git is the best software I know for version control and here I had the opportunity to use some features I had never used—branch and merge.

All in all, it was fun and very satisfying to upgrade the netbox-scanner version, and consequently, I learned a lot of things. I think this is the core concept of [free software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) when you use something and is able to contribute to that.

Let's move to the next objectives!
